      <p class="wrap">
        RegexSearch is a Java application that performs <i>find</i> and <i>find-and-replace</i>
        searches for regular expressions on multiple text files.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section1-1">1.1&nbsp; Features</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        RegexSearch has the following features:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          It can search for literal text or regular expressions.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced">
          <div class="wrap">
            The search can be performed on the following:
          </div>
          <ul class="noSpaceAbove">
            <li class="wrap">
              a single file,
            </li>
            <li class="wrap">
              a directory, with optional recursion,
            </li>
            <li class="wrap">
              the files and directories listed in a text file,
            </li>
            <li class="wrap">
              the files in which the target was found in a previous search, or
            </li>
            <li class="wrap">
              text on the system clipboard.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="wrap">
            Files can be included in and excluded from the search by means of pathname filters,
            which allow bounded recursion.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          Occurrences of the target expression within each file are displayed in a scrollable
          window, with the matched text highlighted.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          Occurrences of the target expression can be replaced individually or globally.  If the
          target is a regular expression, the replacement can include arbitrary parts of the
          matched text.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          Replacements can be previewed, then accepted or rejected.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          The parsing and matching of regular expressions is performed by the robust Java
          regular-expression engine.  The syntax of Java&apos;s regular expressions is similar
          to that of Python and Perl.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          The results of a search (number of matches, number of replacements) are displayed for
          each file in which a match is found.  The results can be copied to the system
          clipboard in a form that is suitable for use as a list file to limit the scope of a
          new search.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          Although a file cannot be edited in RegexSearch&apos;s text view, a command can be
          issued to open the file in an external editor.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="section1-2">1.2&nbsp; Licence</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        RegexSearch is made available under two licences:

      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        This section assumes that you have some experience of building and running a Java
        application.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section2-1">2.1&nbsp; Building the application</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        A Java Development Kit (JDK) that supports Java 17, such as <a class="external"
        href="https://adoptium.net/">Eclipse Temurin from Adoptium</a>, is required to build
        RegexSearch.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The <code>src</code> directory of the repository contains all the source code and
        resources that constitute the application; there are no external dependencies.  The
        directory conforms to the Maven standard directory layout: the source code is in
        <code>src/main/java</code> and the resources are in <code>src/main/resources</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The supplied Kotlin-DSL-based <a class="external" href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>
        build script, <code>build.gradle.kts</code>, modifies the <code>compileJava</code> and
        <code>jar</code> tasks (provided by the <code>java</code> plug-in) to compile the
        application and to create an executable JAR file for it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section2-2">2.2&nbsp; Running the application</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        The supplied Kotlin-DSL-based Gradle build script, <code>build.gradle.kts</code>,
        defines two tasks that may be used to run RegexSearch:
      </p>
      <dl class="basic">
        <dt>runMain</dt>
        <dd class="wrap">
          Runs the main class from the class files that were generated by the
          <code>compileJava</code> task.
        </dd>
        <dt>runJar</dt>
        <dd class="wrap">
          Runs the executable JAR that was generated by the <code>jar</code> task.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p class="wrap">
        Both tasks extend the <code>JavaExec</code> task.
      </p>

    </div>

    <!--=====================================================================================-->

    <!-- Configuration -->

    <div class="section">
      <h2 id="section3">3&nbsp; Configuration</h2>
      <p class="tocLink">
        [ <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a> ]
      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        When it starts up, RegexSearch is configured with <i>configuration properties</i> that
        are read from two sources: the <a href="#section3-1">command line</a> of the Java
        launcher and a <a href="#section3-2">configuration file</a> whose location may be
        explicitly specified.  If the same property is specified on the command line and in a
        configuration file, the value from the configuration file takes precedence.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The recommended method of setting the properties in a configuration file is with the <a
        class="command" href="#section6-5-1">Options &gt; Preferences</a> command.  For
        command-line properties, which must be edited manually, the form of the property values
        is given in an <a href="#sectionB">appendix</a>, and it can also be inferred by
        generating a configuration file with the desired values and inspecting the contents of
        the file.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section3-1">3.1&nbsp; Command-line properties</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        When RegexSearch is run, configuration properties may be passed to the <code>java</code>
        launcher on the command line as system properties; eg,
        <code>-Dapp.general.mainWindowLocation=&quot;100, 0&quot;</code>.  RegexSearch&apos;s
        command-line configuration properties all have the prefix <code>app.</code> . A list of
        all the properties that are recognised by RegexSearch is given in an <a
        href="#sectionB">appendix</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        System properties can be added to the <a href="#section2-2">two supplied Gradle
        tasks</a>, <code>runMain</code> and <code>runJar</code>, with the
        <code>systemProperties(Map&lt;String, ?&gt;)</code> method.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        One particular property, <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span>, is used to
        specify the directory that contains a configuration file, as <a
        href="#section3-2-1">described below</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section3-2">3.2&nbsp; Configuration file</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        The configuration file is named <code>regexSearch-config.xml</code>.  RegexSearch
        doesn&apos;t require a configuration file: it uses a default value for any configuration
        property that is missing from the source(s) of configuration.  Similarly, if it finds a
        property value to be invalid, RegexSearch will display a message to this effect and use
        the default value of the property.  If the configuration file contains a property that
        was specified on the command line, the value from the configuration file is used.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If the configuration has changed when you exit the application normally (ie, using the
        <a class="command" href="#section6-1-3">File &gt; Exit</a> command or an equivalent),
        RegexSearch will save its configuration to a configuration file.  If a configuration
        file was read on startup, it will overwrite that file; otherwise, it will write a
        configuration file to the default directory described above, unless the value of the
        <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property was an empty string.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A configuration file can be written explicitly with the <span class="command">Save
        configuration</span> command within the <span class="component">Preferences</span>
        dialog.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section3-2-1">3.2.1&nbsp; Location of the configuration file</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        When it starts up, RegexSearch is informed of the location of the configuration file
        with the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property.  The value of the
        property may contain <a href="#sectionB">special constructs</a> for system properties,
        environment variables and the user&apos;s home directory.
      </p>
      <p class="noBottomMargin wrap">
        The <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property may be set in two ways:
      </p>
      <ul class="continuationList">
        <li class="wrap">
          on the command line that runs the <code>java</code> launcher, or
        </li>
        <li class="wrap">
          in a file named <code>regexSearch-properties.xml</code> that resides in the same
          directory as the <code>regexSearch.jar</code> JAR file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="wrap">
        The <code>regexSearch-properties.xml</code> file is a legacy from the time when
        RegexSearch was distributed as a JAR file with an installer; the properties file was
        written by the installer.  If you create a properties file, it should have the following
        form, with the example pathname replaced by the actual pathname:
      </p>
      <pre class="codeFragment">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM &quot;http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;properties&gt;
&lt;entry key=&quot;app.configDir&quot;&gt;/home/slothrop/.blankaspect/regexSearch&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;</pre>

      <p class="wrap">
        If the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property is set both on the
        command line and in the properties file, the value in the properties file takes
        precedence.
      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        The existence and value of the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span>
        property determines the locations that are searched for a configuration file:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          If the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property exists and the
          property value is an empty string, RegexSearch will start without a configuration
          file.  No configuration file will be written when the application exits.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          If the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property exists and the
          property value is not empty, RegexSearch will look for a configuration file in the
          directory specified by the property.  An error message is displayed if a configuration
          file is not found in the specified directory.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced">
          <div class="wrap">
            If the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property does not exist,
            RegexSearch will look for a configuration file at two other locations:
          </div>
          <ol class="list">

                systems, the default directory is
                <code>%APPDATA%\blankaspect\regexSearch</code>, where <code>%APPDATA%</code> is
                an environment variable.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="wrap">
        The search parameters are stored collectively as an XML file.  The DTD of the current
        version of a search-parameter file can be found in <a
        href="https://github.com/blankaspect/regexSearch/blob/master/dtd/searchParameters.dtd">a
        file</a> in the RegexSearch repository.  It is provided only for reference because
        RegexSearch does not validate search-parameter files against the DTD.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A search-parameter file may contain multiple file sets, targets and replacements, and
        each file set may contain multiple <a href="#section4-1-1">pathnames</a> and <a
        href="#section4-1-2">pathname filters</a>, though only a single pathname, inclusion
        filter, exclusion filter, target and replacement are used in a search.  For each of
        those five parameters, RegexSearch&apos;s user interface allows you to select from the
        list of available values, to edit or delete existing values and to add new ones to the
        list.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">

      </p>

      <h3 id="section4-1">4.1&nbsp; File set</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        A <i>file set</i> specifies the files that are searched in a <i>find</i> or
        <i>find-and-replace</i> operation.  A file set has a <a href="#section4-1-3">file-set
        kind</a> and, depending on its file-set kind, it may also have a <a
        href="#section4-1-1">pathname</a> and two kinds of <a href="#section4-1-2">pathname
        filter</a>: an inclusion filter and an exclusion filter.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-1-1">4.1.1&nbsp; Pathname</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        Depending on the file-set kind, the <i>pathname</i> of a file set may be direct or
        indirect.  A direct pathname denotes either a single file or a base directory that, in
        conjunction with inclusion and exclusion filters, defines the scope of a search.  An
        indirect pathname denotes a file that contains a list of files and directories to be
        searched.  A pathname may be absolute or relative; a relative pathname is relative to
        the current working directory.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-1-2">4.1.2&nbsp; Pathname filters</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        The inclusion filters and exclusion filters of a file set are two kinds of <i>pathname
        filter</i>.  A pathname filter is a set of patterns that determines, usually in
        conjunction with a base pathname, the files that are searched.  A file is included in a
        search if it matches at least one pattern in the inclusion filter <small>AND</small>
        none of the patterns in the exclusion filter.  The maximum number of patterns in a
        filter is 64.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A pattern is a pathname that may include <i>wildcards</i>.  There are three wildcards:
        two filename wildcards and a pathname wildcard.

        The filename wildcards, <code>?</code> and <code>*</code>, have their usual meaning:
        <code>?</code> matches a single character and <code>*</code> matches zero or more
        characters in a pathname component (a filename or directory name).  For example, the
        pattern &quot;foo*.txt&quot; will match the filenames <code>foo.txt</code>,
        <code>food.txt</code> and <code>football.txt</code>.  Following the UNIX convention (but
        differing from the Windows convention), a dot, <code>.</code>, has no special
        significance in patterns: it is matched by the <code>*</code> wildcard.  Thus, the
        pattern &quot;foo*&quot; will match the filenames <code>foo</code>,
        <code>football.txt</code> and <code>food.store.log</code>.
      </p>

      <h5 id="section4-1-2-2">4.1.2.2&nbsp; Pathname wildcards</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        The pathname wildcard, <code>**</code>, matches zero or more pathname components.  Its
        use in a pathname pattern is analogous to the use of <code>*</code> in a filename
        pattern.  By itself, the pattern <code>**</code> is the recursive analogue of
        <code>*</code>: it matches all files in or below the base directory.  Used as a pathname
        component in a larger pattern, <code>**</code> denotes a recursive portion of the
        pathname that may be bounded above or below by a non-recursive pathname.  For example,
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="wrap">
          the pattern &quot;**/*.txt&quot; matches all files with the filename suffix
          <code>.txt</code> in the base directory and in all directories below the base
          directory;
        </li>
        <li class="wrap">
          the pattern &quot;editor/**/config/*.xml&quot; matches all files with the filename
          suffix <code>.xml</code> in all directories named <code>config</code> that are in or
          below the directory named <code>editor</code> in the base directory;
        </li>
        <li class="wrap">
          the pattern &quot;**/test/**/*.java&quot; matches all files with the filename suffix
          <code>.java</code> in or below any directory named <code>test</code> that is below the
          base directory (or in the base directory, if it is named <code>test</code>).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="wrap">
        A pathname-filter pattern may be either relative to a base directory (in a directory or
        list file set), or it may be absolute.  The pathname components in a pattern are
        separated with a <code>/</code> character (U+002F).  (A <code>\</code> may be used as
        the directory separator on the Windows platform, but <code>/</code> is recommended
        because <code>\</code> is used as the escape character in <a href="#section5-5-2">filter
        fields</a>.) A pattern that ends with a directory separator is assumed to be followed by
        an implicit <code>**</code>.  A pattern that, when appended to its base directory,
        denotes an existing directory is assumed to be followed by an implicit <code>/**</code>.
        A pattern may contain dot and double-dot components (<code>.</code> and
        <code>..</code>), but only if they appear <em>before</em> the first wildcard in the
        pattern.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A file is matched against a pathname-filter pattern by converting both the pattern
        (appended to a base directory, if the pattern is relative) and the pathname of the
        target file to a canonical form.  An error may occur in converting the pattern to
        canonical form if, for example, the resulting pathname is illegal or access to part of
        the file system is not permitted.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-1-3">4.1.3&nbsp; File-set kinds</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        A <i>file-set kind</i> may be one of File, Directory, List, Results or Clipboard.  The
        five kinds of file set are described below.
      </p>

      <h5 id="section4-1-3-1">4.1.3.1&nbsp; File</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        The search is performed on the file denoted by the pathname of the file set.  No
        inclusion filter or exclusion filter is applied.
      </p>

      <h5 id="section4-1-3-2">4.1.3.2&nbsp; Directory</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        The pathname of the file set denotes the base directory of the search.  (A search is not
        necessarily confined to this directory and the directories below it because the
        inclusion filter may contain patterns that denote pathnames outside the base directory.)
        An inclusion filter and an exclusion filter may be specified.  If no inclusion filter is
        specified, a filter consisting of the single pattern <code>**</code> (match all
        recursively) is assumed.  Any relative patterns (see <a href="#section4-1-2">pathname
        filter</a>) in the inclusion filter and exclusion filter are relative to the base
        directory.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The files in a directory are searched in order of filename.  The ordering is
        lexicographic (ie, the Unicode values of characters in the filename are compared) and
        platform-dependent: it is case-sensitive on Linux/UNIX systems, but alphabetic case is
        ignored on Windows systems.  Recursion is specified implicitly by <a
        href="#section4-1-2-2">pathname wildcards</a>.  A recursive search on a directory is
        depth-first: files in subdirectories are searched before the files in the directory.
        Like files, subdirectories are searched in order of name.  If the inclusion filter
        contains any absolute patterns, the files or directories specified by those patterns are
        searched <em>after</em> the base directory.
      </p>

      <h5 id="section4-1-3-3">4.1.3.3&nbsp; List</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        The pathname of the file set is assumed to denote a text file, each of whose non-empty
        lines denotes the pathname of a file or directory that is to be searched.  A line of the
        list file may contain a comment, beginning with a <code>;</code> character.  If a line
        contains a comment, any characters after the last non-space character before the comment
        are ignored (eg, the line &quot;simple-filename.txt&nbsp;;&nbsp;file #23&quot; is parsed
        as &quot;simple-filename.txt&quot;).  Empty lines are ignored.  The pathnames are
        validated before the search starts, and the search will not proceed unless each pathname
        denotes an existing directory or a regular file.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        An inclusion filter and an exclusion filter may be specified.  If no inclusion filter is
        specified, a filter consisting of the single pattern <code>**</code> (match all
        recursively) is assumed.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The search of the pathnames in the list is equivalent to a sequence of searches on file
        sets whose file-set kind is either File or Directory according to whether a pathname
        denotes a file or directory.  If the pathname denotes a directory, the inclusion filter
        and any exclusion filter are applied to it.  If the inclusion filter contains any
        absolute patterns, the files or directories specified by those patterns are searched
        <em>after</em> all the pathnames in the list.
      </p>

      <h5 id="section4-1-3-4">4.1.3.4&nbsp; Results</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        The files that will be searched are those from the last list of files to be saved with
        the <a class="command" href="#section6-4-3">Search &gt; Save results</a> command.  The
        current list of saved results can be viewed with the <a class="command"
        href="#section6-4-4">Search &gt; View saved results</a> command.  No inclusion filter or
        exclusion filter is applied.
      </p>

      <h5 id="section4-1-3-5">4.1.3.5&nbsp; Clipboard</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        This denotes a &quot;pseudo-file&quot;: the contents of the system clipboard.  If the
        clipboard contains text, the text will be searched in the same way as if it were read
        from a file.  In a <i>find-and-replace</i> search, if any changes are made to the text,
        the modified text is put back on the clipboard at the end of the search.  No inclusion
        filter or exclusion filter is applied.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section4-2">4.2&nbsp; Target</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        The <i>target</i> of the search &mdash; the pattern that you are attempting to match in
        the files that are searched &mdash; can be either literal text or a regular expression.
        The corresponding kinds of search are referred to below as <i>literal-text search</i>
        and <i>regular-expression search</i>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section4-3">4.3&nbsp; Replacement</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        The <i>replacement</i> is an expression that will be used to replace occurrences of the
        target pattern in a <i>find-and-replace</i> search.  The interpretation of the
        replacement differs according to whether the target is literal text or a regular
        expression.  Both types of replacement may contain <i>metasymbols</i> &mdash; special
        sequences that are introduced with an escape character.  By default, the escape
        character is a backslash, <code>\</code>, but it can be changed with the <a
        class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-general-replacementEscapeCharacter">general.replacementEscapeCharacter</a>
        configuration property if, for example, you want to avoid having to escape the
        backslashes in Windows pathnames.  In a replacement, an escape character must always be
        escaped by prefixing another escape character to it (eg, <code>\\</code>, if the escape
        character is <code>\</code>).

      <p class="wrap">
        When a file containing tab characters (U+0009) is displayed in the text view,
        RegexSearch uses two configuration properties &mdash; <a
        href="#cp-tabWidth-fileFilter"><i>tab-width filters</i></a> and default tab width
        &mdash; to determine how the tab characters are converted to spaces.  A tab-width filter
        maps a filename filter (a set of patterns that are used to match filenames) to the
        number of spaces that will be used to replace tab characters when displaying a matching
        file.  If none of the defined tab-width filters matches the file, the default tab width
        is used.  If the tab width is zero, tab characters are not expanded but rendered as a
        U+2192 (rightwards arrow) character, or as the &quot;not defined&quot; glyph if the font
        doesn&apos;t contain a glyph for the arrow character.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The filename-filter part of the tab-width filter consists of one or more filename
        patterns separated by spaces; for instance, &quot;*.cpp *.h&quot;. If a filename matches
        one of the patterns, it is included in the search in the case of the inclusive filter or
        excluded from the search in the case of the exclusive filter.  A pattern may be a
        literal filename or it may contain the wildcards <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>,
        which have their usual meaning: <code>*</code> matches zero or more characters and
        <code>?</code> matches a single character.

        pressing Alt+Enter.  (For the filter fields, the command can be issued with the Edit
        button adjacent to the field.)  Within the list editor, the position of an item in the
        list can be changed by dragging it with the mouse, or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Up or
        Ctrl+Shift+Down when the list has keyboard focus.  The Delete key and Delete button
        delete the selected item after confirmation, while Shift+Delete and Shift+left-click on

      <p class="wrap">
        The fields contain a pathname filter: a set of patterns separated by spaces.  Within the
        field, the backslash, <code>\</code>, acts as an escape character to allow the inclusion
        of space characters in patterns.  The escape convention in the filter fields is that a
        character following a <code>\</code> is treated as a literal character, and a single
        trailing <code>\</code> is ignored.  Thus, you would use <code>\&nbsp;</code> for a
        literal space and <code>\\</code> for a literal backslash.  Because of this, it is
        recommended that you use a <code>/</code> to separate pathname components in patterns on
        the Windows platform.

        an unwanted &mdash; and invisble &mdash; line feed at the end of the field.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The fields may use a <a href="#section5-5-3-1">tab surrogate</a> to display tab
        characters.  Some characters in the fields may be <i>escaped</i> in two different ways:
        <a href="#section5-5-3-2">tabs and line feeds</a> can be escaped separately, and an
        <span class="command">Escape</span> command can be applied to the field.  The <span
        class="command">Escape</span> command behaves differently in the <a
        href="#section5-5-3-3"><span class="component">Target</span> field</a> and the <a

      <h5 id="section5-5-3-1">5.5.3.1&nbsp; Tab surrogate</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        Within the <span class="component">Target</span> and <span
        class="component">Replacement</span> fields, tabs are replaced with the character that
        is denoted by the <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-appearance-tabSurrogate">appearance.tabSurrogate</a> configuration property.
        The default tab surrogate is the tab character (U+0009) itself; in this case, tabs are
        displayed as a number of spaces up to the next tab stop, and the tab width is denoted by
        the <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-tabWidth-targetAndReplacement">tabWidth.targetAndReplacement</a> configuration
        property.  It is important to understand that the tab surrogate is not just a substitute
        glyph: it actually replaces each occurrence of the tab character in the field unless
        tabs are <a href="#section5-5-3-2">escaped</a>.  When the content of the field is used
        (eg, in a search), the tab surrogate is converted either to a tab character or to a tab
        sequence (&quot;\t&quot;) as appropriate, so you should choose as tab surrogate a
        character that is unlikely to appear in any target or replacement text.
      </p>

      <h5 id="section5-5-3-2">5.5.3.2&nbsp; Escaping tabs and line feeds</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        Tabs and line feeds may be escaped (ie, converted to the escape sequences
        &quot;<code>\t</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>\n</code>&quot; respectively) in the <span
        class="component">Target</span> and <span class="component">Replacement</span> fields by
        selecting the <span class="component">Tabs escaped</span> or <span
        class="component">Line feeds escaped</span> item in the field&apos;s pop-up menu.  (In
        reality, it is the tab surrogate that is converted to &quot;<code>\t</code>&quot;, but
        the existence of tab surrogates is ignored in this section so as not to complicate
        matters.)  Deselecting the menu item reverses the procedure: each occurrence of
        &quot;<code>\t</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>\n</code>&quot; is converted to a tab
        character or line-feed character, even if the <code>\</code> is itself escaped with
        another backslash.  You will need to be careful about toggling the escaping of tabs and
        line feeds if the text contains literal &quot;<code>\t</code>&quot; or
        &quot;<code>\n</code>&quot; sequences.  Within the field, the escaping of tabs and line
        feeds can be toggled from the keyboard with Ctrl+T and Ctrl+N respectively.  Indicators
        appear alongside a field in which tabs or line feeds are escaped.

        When a regular-expression search is performed, any tab characters and line-feed
        characters in the <span class="component">Target</span> field are escaped automatically

        in the list of target or replacement items displayed in the editor, in the <span

      <h5 id="section6-4-1-3">6.4.1.3&nbsp; How files are processed</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        Some aspects of RegexSearch&apos;s behaviour when processing files are worth noting in
        order that you may avoid the unintended consequences of that behaviour.  RegexSearch
        assumes that the files it reads during a search are text files that have a specified
        character set and encoding.  It also assumes that certain characters or character
        sequences in the files are line separators.  The implications of these two assumptions
        are discussed below.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        When a file is read during a search, the bytes of the file are converted to 16-bit
        Unicode according to the configuration property <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-general-characterEncoding">general.characterEncoding</a>.  A character
        encoding, such as UTF-8, maps between sequences of bytes and 16-bit Unicode values.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        Within the file, all occurrences of the characters LF (U+000A) and CR (U+000D), and the
        character sequence (CR, LF) are treated as line separators.  The kind of line separator
        is recorded for possible later use.  If the file contains more than one kind of line
        separator, the most numerous kind of line separator prevails.  If the numbers of
        different kinds are equal, the precedence from highest to lowest is: LF &ndash; CR
        &ndash; CR+LF.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        In <i>find</i> mode, the processing of a file ends at this point: the processing is
        internal, and no physical changes are made to the stored file.  In
        <i>find-and-replace</i> mode, a file may be modified as a result of a replacement, and
        the file written back to the file system.  If the <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-general-preserveLineSeparator">general.preserveLineSeparator</a> configuration
        property has the value <code>true</code>, the file is written with the kind of line
        separator that was detected when it was read; otherwise, it is written with an LF line
        separator.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The way in which a modified file is written to the file system is determined by the <a
        class="configProperty" href="#cp-general-fileWritingMode">general.fileWritingMode</a>
        configuration property.  A file may be written directly, or it may be written first to a
        temporary file that is renamed after the entire file has been written.  If a temporary
        file is used, the owner, group and permissions of the file may be set to those of the
        original file on systems that support it.  (Linux is the only system that is known to do
        so.)  See the description of the <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-general-fileWritingMode">general.fileWritingMode</a> property for more details

                When a file containing tab characters (U+0009) is displayed, RegexSearch uses
                two properties &mdash; a list of tab-width filters and a default tab width
                &mdash; to determine how the tab characters are converted to spaces.  A
                tab-width filter is a filename filter that is mapped to a tab width.  The
                filename filter consists of one or more space-separated filename patterns (eg,
                &quot;*.c *.cpp *.h *.hpp&quot;).  Up to 64 tab-width filters can be specified.
                Filters are applied in the order in which they appear in the list.  The default
                tab width is used for a file whose name does not match any filter.
              </dd>
              <dd class="spaceAbove wrap">
                New filters can be added to the list, and items in the list can be edited,
                deleted or their position in the list changed.  The Delete key and Delete button
                delete the selected item after confirmation, while Shift+Delete and
                Shift+left-click on the Delete button delete the selected item without
                confirmation.  The position of an item in the list can be changed by dragging it
                with the mouse, or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Up or Ctrl+Shift+Down when the list
                has keyboard focus.

      <h2 id="section7">7&nbsp; Regular expressions</h2>
      <p class="tocLink">
        [ <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a> ]
      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        Within RegexSearch, the parsing and matching of regular expressions is performed by the
        Java regex engine.  The purpose of this section is to present a summary of the syntax of
        Java&apos;s regular expressions, which is similar to that of Perl and Python.  This
        section is not intended to be a tutorial on the use of regular expressions; see the <a
        href="#section7-6">references</a> at the end of this section for suggested sources of
        further information.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        <strong>Note:</strong> There are several differences between the syntax of regular
        expressions in Java and the syntax of regular expressions in Linux/UNIX tools such as
        <i>sed</i> and <i>(g)awk</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        In a search, the target pattern, replacement pattern and file are all composed of
        Unicode characters.  RegexSearch converts files from bytes to 16-bit Unicode characters
        according to the scheme described in <a href="#section6-4-1-3">How files are
        processed</a>.  In particular, the line separators CR and CR+LF are converted to LF
        before a file is searched.  Thereafter, by default, the only line separator recognised
        during a search is the line feed character (U+000A) unless the <code>(?-d)</code> flag
        appears in the target pattern.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        When selected, the <span class="component">Ignore case</span> check box in the control
        dialog enables the default form of case-insensitive matching, which applies only to
        characters in the US-ASCII character encoding.  To apply case-insensitive matching to
        all Unicode characters, use the <code>(?u)</code> flag in the target pattern.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        Within a regular expression, all characters are treated as literal characters except for
        twelve <i>metacharacters</i> &mdash; characters that have a special meaning and
        don&apos;t behave normally in regular expressions.  The metacharacters are:
      </p>
      <p class="shaded">
        <code class="noBackground">$ ( ) * + . ? [ \ ^ { |</code>
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A metacharacter can be <i>escaped</i> &mdash; that is, its special meaning can be
        removed &mdash; by prefixing a backslash, <code>\</code>, to it.  An escaped
        metacharacter represents its corresponding literal character; thus, <code>\?</code>
        represents the character <code>?</code>, and <code>\\</code> represents a literal
        backslash.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        Some metacharacters are used by theselves within regular expressions; others are used to
        create special sequences called <i>metasymbols</i>.  (In the documentation for
        <code>java.util.regex.Pattern</code>, metasymbols are referred to as <i>constructs</i>.)
        For example, several alphanumeric characters become metasymbols when preceded by a
        backslash.

      <h3 id="section7-2">7.2&nbsp; Quantifiers</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        Quantifiers specify how many times the preceding character or group should match.  The
        different types of quantifier are available in three flavours, which Java refers to as
        <i>greedy</i>, <i>reluctant</i> and <i>possessive</i>.  (Greedy quantifiers are also
        known as <i>maximal</i>, and reluctant quantifiers are also known as <i>lazy</i> or
        <i>minimal</i>.)
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A greedy (maximal) quantifier starts by matching as much as possible of the input
        string.  If this doesn&apos;t allow the whole pattern to be matched, the greedy
        quantifier matches progressively less of the input string until either the whole pattern
        is matched or the match fails.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A reluctant (minimal) quantifier starts by matching as little as possible of the input
        string.  If this doesn&apos;t allow the whole pattern to be matched, the reluctant
        quantifier matches progressively more of the input string until either the whole pattern
        is matched or the match fails.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A possessive quantifier starts, like a greedy quantifier, by matching as much as
        possible of the input string.  However, if this doesn&apos;t allow the whole pattern to
        be matched, no backing-up is performed, and the match fails.

      <p class="wrap">
        The Java character classes will probably be of interest only to Java programmers.  The
        name of the character class is formed by substituting <code>java</code> for
        <code>is</code> in the name of a method of the <code><a class="external"
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Character.html">java.lang.Character</a></code>
        class that begins with <code>is</code>.  For example, the character class
        <code>javaLetterOrDigit</code> is equivalent to
        <code>java.lang.Character.isLetterOrDigit()</code>.

      <p class="wrap">
        Extended sequences are metasymbols of the form <code>(?...)</code>.  The modifiers,
        <code>[dimsux]</code>, and their &quot;off&quot; versions (preceded by a minus sign) can
        be concatenated within an extended sequence; for example, <code>(?iu-ms)</code> switches
        on <code>i</code> and <code>u</code> and switches off <code>m</code> and <code>s</code>.

        The table below lists the configuration properties of RegexSearch.  Apart from the <span
        class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property, which, for obvious reasons, cannot
        be used within a configuration file, all properties can be used in the two configuration
        locations: command-line properties and configuration file.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        When used in a <code>-D</code> command-line property, <code>app.</code> must be prefixed
        to the property key (eg, <span

      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The <i>&lt;index&gt;</i> of a indexed property must be a three-digit decimal-string
        representation of the zero-based index of the property (eg, the third tab-width filter
        would be <span class="configProperty">app.tabWidth.fileFilter.002</span>).
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        When used in a configuration file, the components of the property keys become element
        names in the XML document hierarchy.  (The <code>app</code> prefix of the property key
        in command-line properties corresponds to the root element of the XML document.)  The
        form of properties in a configuration file was changed in version 2.1 of RegexSearch.
        Configuration files in the old format can be read, but files are written in the new
        format.

        Any commas (<code>,</code>) or backslash characters (<code>\</code>) in the name of a
